								<h2>App function</h2>
								<h3> See Friends' favorite coffee menu </h3>

								<p>On boarding process, users need to select their profile which includes their favorite coffee shop brands' menu. It means when user add their friends on their friends list, they can easily find out their friend's favorite coffee menu. When they need chance to buy some cup of coffees for their friends, the user just need to open their friend's page. </p>
								<p>On their profile page, each user can select what brand they prefer most. Moreover, to be more detailed, they can select each coffee shop brand's favorite menu brand by brand. So For example, User A's favorite coffee of Starbucks is Dolce Latte, but for Tom and Toms, it can be Mocha Latte. So it will help users' friends to buy best coffee for them whenever their friends want to buy one.
</p>

								<h3>Collect other's recipe</h3>
								<p>Because there are lots of new recipes for coffee brands' custom menu, I thought there is some need to collect and manage or write new recipes. By this app, users can bookmark interesting recipes, but also can write new recipe. When a recipe get many bookmarks, then they can go to home screen's "Best recipe of weel".</p>


								<h3>Write a recipe</h3>
								<p>To write new recipe, the user need to select a brand from 16 popular coffee shop brand of Korea. Then, based on brad information, the app will provide interface for entering drinks' information. For example, Starbucks divided their drinks types to "Coffee & Espresso," "Frappuccino," "Blended," "Starbuck Fizzio," so the user need to select drink type first, then select their base drink, then add whipping and syrups. All costumed drinks can be distinguished by syrups and whippings, so I think it is effective ways to costume drinks. There is ETC section for additional information, but If all the other information of "drink", "whipping," and "syrups" are same, then the app will recognize the recipe as already existing recipe, so user cannot publish same recipe again and again. 
</p>

								<h2> Design </h2>
								<p> For the design, I tried to keep lovely and friendly mood. I used White and babypink, which is very nice-feeling-color, or color of love. I pretend this is an app for coffee lover,sweet recipe to heal users mind as my catchphrase, "Coffee for your life, recipe for your love," so I thought lovely mood was important. </p>
